# Flight Delay Analysis

## Overview

This repository presents a comprehensive data analysis project examining the factors contributing to flight delays. The analysis is based on a dataset containing detailed records of 336,776 flights from the year 2013. Each entry includes attributes such as departure and arrival times, delays, airline carriers, origin and destination airports, and other relevant metrics.

## Project Structure

- **Jupyter Notebook (`Flights.ipynb`)**  
  Contains the full data analysis workflow, including data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.

- **Dataset (`flights.csv`)**  
  The raw data used for analysis, sourced from publicly available flight records for the year 2013.

## Key Insights & Analysis

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Performed to understand the distribution and quality of the data.

- **Delay Correlation Analysis:**  
  Investigated how various features (e.g., departure time, carrier, origin airport) correlate with arrival delays.

- **Data Visualization:**  
  Utilized a range of visual techniques including histograms, scatter plots, violin plots, and a correlation heatmap to highlight significant trends and relationships.
